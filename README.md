### Idealogies

Code style and conventions are important to maintain a healthy codebase. We have a few ideologies that we follow to ensure this.

#### Tailwind

We don't use css/scss as you would usually expect, as we use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style all components and pages. This allows us to prevent css rot and maintain components more easily in the long run.

#### Typescript

We use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) where possible for all components and pages. This forces good conventions and has very little downside.
